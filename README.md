## Project Introduction
This is the front-end part of our task manager app for CS 8803 MAS. We mainly use React Native in this front-end development. <br>

Users are able to create an account for themselves and log in using that account to our app. In the app, users are able to create, read, update, and delete their to do lists. 

The backend of our app is here: https://github.com/huahanqi/CS8803-task-manager-backend
